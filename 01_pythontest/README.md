# First test on Python
Goal: check that we can control GPIO from the Raspberry Pi

# Steps:
TODO: How to Connect? maybe create a 00_Preparations step
Copy over test.py to the Raspberry Pi 
Connect an LED with a resistor as seen on https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xCWXjnFCGk4
run:
sudo python3 ./test.py
...and check that the LED blinks
