# Testing the Arduino works
- Connect the Arduino to your laptop
- Launch Arduino IDE
- Open this folder
- Connect to the Serial endpoint(and port) on the Arduino IDE
- Load the program
- Once it works, you can connect it to the Raspi, boot the robot, and see it does what was loaded to do
  - Obviously at first you can only test an LED, later you will probably use Serial to see information moving to the robot.
